## Gerunds and infinitives

Gerunds and infinitives are used to talk about complex ideas.
Gerunds are formed with **ing**. Infinitives are formed with **to + a verb**. You can use infinitives and gerunds after certain verbs.

**Gerund (verb + ing):**
- Oscar enjoys **cooking** dinner for Frank

**Infinitive (to + verb):**
- Frank plans **to eat** out

Some verbs can only have gerunds after them, whereas some can only have infinitives. Some verbs can have either gerunds or infinitives.

These verbs can only have an infinitive after them:

## Adjective order

When you use more than one adjective in a description, a general rule is to put them in order by **size**, then **age**, then **color**.

Notice the size-age-color order in these examples:
- That is a fat, old, black dog
- He has big, brown eyes
- He's a thin, middle-aged man
- Her hair is shorter and grayer than before
- That tall, young, blond man drives a truck

## Adverbs at work

Adverbs explain how, when or where. They can describe a verb, an adjective or another adverb. Many adverbs end in **-ly** and these are easiest to recognize and form. But many adverbs don't end in **-ly**, and the best way to identify these is to connect them to the verb, adjective or adverb that they modify.

Use adverbs of manner with a verb to indicate the way something is done.

e.g.
- Martina _**works quickly**_
- She _**works well**_ with the team
-  I _**highly recommend**_ Martina
-  I'm going to _**miss**_ her _**terribly**_
- Her husband _**is already**_ in New York
- She's _**leaving**_ that _**soon**_?

Use adverbs of frequency with a verb to indicate the frequency of an action.

e.g.
-She _**was always**_ organized

Use adverbs of probability with a verb to indicate the likelihood of an action.

e.g.
- She can _**probably learn**_  that in one or two days

You can use **only** with a verb to draw attention to information.

e.g.
- The project _**only took**_ her one day

You can use adverbs to modify adjectives.

e.g.
- The brochure was _**really beautiful**_
- She's _**so creative**_

Some adverbs modify other adverbs. Notice how **pretty** and **so** add extra detail to these sentences.

e.g.
- She can learn that _**pretty quickly**_
- He writes  _**so well**_

You can use the adverb **honestly** at the front of a sentence to emphasize a point.

e.g.
- _**Honestly**_, what are we going to do?
