# Rules

## Gerunds and infinitives
Gerunds and infinitives are used to talk about complex ideas.\
Gerunds are formed with **ing**. Infinitives are formed with **to + a verb**. You can use infinitives and gerunds after certain verbs.\

**Gerund (verb + ing):**
- Oscar enjoys **cooking** dinner for Frank

**Infinitive (to + verb):**
- Frank plans **to eat** out

Some verbs can only have gerunds after them, whereas some can only have infinitives. Some verbs can have either gerunds or infinitives.\

These verbs can only have an infinitive after them:

Verb | e.g.
--- | ---
Plan | We're **planning to go** to the soccer game
Want | We **want to see** the play in the park this week
Need | I **need to get** some money for the concert

These verbs can only have a gerund after them:

Verb | e.g.
--- | ---
Enjoy | I **enjoy listening** to music.
Keep | Martin **kept playing** his guitar until midnight
Think about | We're **thinking about** going to a concert

These verbs can only have a gerund after them:

Verb | e.g.
--- | ---
Like | I **like going to** musicals
Love | Joan **loves eating** in restaurants
Begin | It **began to snow**

## The

Suena "de" cuando la siguiente palabra es una vocal y

"da" when the next word is a consonant*.

## Continues present

put a extra **n**, except when the last word is a **w**. 
For example:

Ex:

- Sit -> Sitning

If the verb ends with **Y** put **ing** at end. 

Ex:
- Enjoy -> Enjoying

## Questions

Be | Do | Does
--- | --- | ---
Am, Is, Are | I, You, We, They | He, She, It

Si la pregunta no contiene el verbo to be se usa el auxiliar do o does
- Who are you?
- Who do you live with?
- Who does she live with?
- Where are you from? 

## Have got
*Have got* means the same as *have*, but is using in certain situations. 
You can use *have got or have* to talk about 
**relationship, things you own or have, your 
schedule, or how something looks**. 
It's usually used with have or has contracted. 

Its contraction is:

- I've / You've / We've / They've got

I've got = I have got
He's got = He has got
