# Rules

## Gerunds and infinitives

Gerunds and infinitives are used to talk about complex ideas.
Gerunds are formed with **ing**. Infinitives are formed with **to + a verb**. You can use infinitives and gerunds after certain verbs.

**Gerund (verb + ing):**
- Oscar enjoys **cooking** dinner for Frank

**Infinitive (to + verb):**
- Frank plans **to eat** out

Some verbs can only have gerunds after them, whereas some can only have infinitives. Some verbs can have either gerunds or infinitives.

These verbs can only have an infinitive after them:

Verb | e.g.
--- | ---
Plan | We're **planning to go** to the soccer game
Want | We **want to see** the play in the park this week
Need | I **need to get** some money for the concert

These verbs can only have a gerund after them:

Verb | e.g.
--- | ---
Enjoy | I **enjoy listening** to music.
Keep | Martin **kept playing** his guitar until midnight
Think about | We're **thinking about** going to a concert

These verbs can only have a gerund after them:

Verb | e.g.
--- | ---
Like | I **like going to** musicals
Love | Joan **loves eating** in restaurants
Begin | It **began to snow**

schedule, or how something looks**. 
It's usually used with have or has contracted. 

Its contraction is:

- I've / You've / We've / They've got

## Whose (¿de quién?)

## Exclamations
Ex:

Spanish|English 
---|---
¡Qué día! | What a day! 
¡Qué chica! | What a girl! 
¡Qué coincidencia! | What a coincidence! 
¡Qué linda chica! | What a beautiful girl! 
¡Qué coincidencia tan agradable! | What a nice coincidence! 

When an exclamation is composed with only 
adjectives, we must use the *how* word. Ex:

Spanish|English 
---|---
¡Qué hermoso! | How beautiful!
¡Qué grosero! | How rude!
¡Qué interesante | How interesting! 

## Adjective order

When you use more than one adjective in a description, a general rule is to put them in order by **size**, then **age**, then **color**.

Notice the size-age-color order in these examples:
- That is a fat, old, black dog
- He has big, brown eyes
- He's a thin, middle-aged man
- Her hair is shorter and grayer than before
- That tall, young, blond man drives a truck

## Adverbs at work

Adverbs explain how, when or where. They can describe a verb, an adjective or another adverb. Many adverbs end in **-ly** and these are easiest to recognize and form. But many adverbs don't end in **-ly**, and the best way to identify these is to connect them to the verb, adjective or adverb that they modify.

Use adverbs of manner with a verb to indicate the way something is done.

e.g.
- Martina _**works quickly**_
- She _**works well**_ with the team
-  I _**highly recommend**_ Martina
-  I'm going to _**miss**_ her _**terribly**_
- Her husband _**is already**_ in New York
- She's _**leaving**_ that _**soon**_?

Use adverbs of frequency with a verb to indicate the frequency of an action.

e.g.
-She _**was always**_ organized

Use adverbs of probability with a verb to indicate the likelihood of an action.

e.g.
- She can _**probably learn**_  that in one or two days

You can use **only** with a verb to draw attention to information.

e.g.
- The project _**only took**_ her one day

You can use adverbs to modify adjectives.

e.g.
- The brochure was _**really beautiful**_
- She's _**so creative**_

Some adverbs modify other adverbs. Notice how **pretty** and **so** add extra detail to these sentences.

e.g.
- She can learn that _**pretty quickly**_
- He writes  _**so well**_

You can use the adverb **honestly** at the front of a sentence to emphasize a point.

e.g.
- _**Honestly**_, what are we going to do?

## Past tense verbs

Many past tense verbs are formed just by adding **-ed** to the end of the present tense verb.

Present | Past
---|---
walk | _walk**ed**_
clean | _clean**ed**_

### Irregular verbs

However, some of the most common verbs are irregular, which means their past forms do not end in **-ed**. They can be formed in many different ways.

Present | Past
---|---
have | _**had**_
make | _**made**_
eat | _**ate**_
drink | _**drank**_
let | _**let**_

### The verb 'be'

The verb **be** has two forms in the past – **was** and **were**. Use **was** with the pronouns **he**, **she**, **it** and **I**. Use **were** with **you**, **we** and **they**.

e.g.
- He _**was**_ tired yesterday
- They _**were**_ happy in Paris

### Negatives

Use **did + not** to make negative past tense verbs. The main verb remains in its base form.

In spoken English, the phrase **did not** is usually contracted to **didn't**.

e.g.
- They _**did not**_ like London
- We ***did not*** meet John yesterday

Use the phrases **was not** and **were not** for the verb **be**. The contractions of these phrases are **wasn't** and **weren't**.

e.g.
- Frank  ***was not*** happy in Los Angeles. > Frank ***wasn't*** happy in Los Angeles
- Oscar and Pam ***were not*** at Home yesterday > Oscar and Pam ***weren't*** at Home yesterday

### Past tense questions

Use the word **did** at the beginning of a sentence to form a past question. Use the base form of the main verb after **did**. Do not add an **-s** to the verb.

e.g.
- ***Did*** he ***go*** to Shanghai?
- ***Did*** they ***eat*** dinner?

To form a past tense question with the verb **be**, put **was** or **were** at the front of the question phrase.

e.g.
He ***was*** happy > ***Was*** he happy?

### Irregular past tense verbs

Many verbs are irregular in the past tense. This means that you can't form the past tense of the verb by simply adding **-ed**.

Some irregular verbs look completely different from their present tense forms. You just need to memorize them.

Present | Past
---|---
go | ***went***
eat | ***ate***
bring | ***brought***
leave | ***left***
sell | ***sold***

Other irregular verbs have past tense forms that have only one letter that changes. These are a little easier to learn.

Present | Past
---|---
make | ***made***
rise | ***rose***
get | ***got***

A few verbs have the same form for both present and past.

Present | Past
---|---
cut | ***cut***
let | ***let***
shut | ***shut***

The verb **read** has the same spelling in the present and the past, but a different pronunciation.

Pronunciation Present | Pronunciation Past
---|---
rid | red
I often ***read*** novels | I ***read*** a good novel last week

## Past tense questions with question words

Past tense questions that don't use the verb **be**, and which begin with a question word, take the auxiliary **did**. Notice also that the main verb stays in its base form.

e.g.
A: **What did** you  **do**  on the weekend?
B: I played badminton

A: **Where did**  you  **go**  for your vacation?
B: I went to Peru

To ask about the owner of an object, use the question word **whose**.

e.g.
A: **Whose**  backpack  **did**  you borrow?
B: I borrowed my brother's

To ask about the category of something, use the question phrase **what kind of**.

e.g.
A: **What kind of**  tent  **did**  you buy?
B: I bought a Shelty. It's the best brand

A: **What kind of**  animals  **did**  you see?
B: We saw deer, wolves and a snake

You can use the question word **how** with many different adjectives to ask for detailed information.

e.g.
- **How far did**  you walk?
- **How difficult** was the hike?

Questions with the verb **be** don't require the auxiliary **did**.

e.g.
A: **How was** your weekend?
B: It was great, thanks.

A: **How long was** your trip?
B: We hiked for two weeks

## 'Be' + 'going to' for plans, and 'will' for predictions

Use **be + going to +** verb to talk about a firm plan or intention for the future.

  
A: What  **are you going to do**  on vacation? 
B: **I'm going to**  visit friends and family. And  **I'm not going to work**

Use **will +** verb to say what you predict or believe will happen. In spoken English, the pronoun and the verb are usually contracted.

- **We'll** probably stay in a hotel
- **I'll** be happy living by the sea
- **You'll** like Paris

When the pronoun and the verb are not contracted, it's usually for a particular emphasis.

- You **will have**  fun
- We **will not figh**

For negative meaning, use **will + not +** verb. The short form is **won't**.

- I **won't get**  sick
- They **won't come** with us

To specify time, you can add future time expressions:

- I'm going to go horseback riding **on Thursday**
- **The next two days** will be an adventure

## Past participles

The past participle form of some irregular verbs is different from the past tense form.

Present | Past | Past Participle
---|---|---
be | was/were | been
come | came | come
do | did | done
get | got | gotten/got
give | gave | given
go | went | gone
see | saw | seen
take | took | taken

Remember to use these past participles to form the present perfect. Also, remember that the present perfect is used to talk about something that happened in the past at an unspecified time.

**Affirmative statement** | **Negative statement** | **Question**
---|---|---
have + past participle | haven't + past participle | Have + subject + past participle + ?

A: **Have you been** to Bolivia?  
B: No, **I haven't been** there before.

> **Language note**: In American English, **I've got** indicates possession,
> as in **I've got my ticket.** Saying **I've gotten a ticket.** means
> you've just obtained or bought one. In British English, **got** is
> used in both cases.

## Adverbs for the present perfect

Use the adverbs **yet**, **already**, **never** and **ever** with the present perfect to indicate a period of time up until the present.

Use the adverb **yet** to refer to something that has not happened yet, or to ask if something has happened yet. The adverb usually comes at the end of the sentence.

- I haven't printed my boarding pass **yet**
- They haven't packed their bags **yet**
- Has she left for the airport **yet**?

Use the adverb **already** to refer to something that has already happened, or to ask if something has already happened. The adverb usually comes directly before the main verb.

- You can't come? But I've **already** booked the tickets!
- Carly has **already** been to Paris, but I haven't
- Has John **already** been to the Louvre?

Use the adverb **ever** to ask if something has happened, or to ask about someone's experiences. For negative responses, use **never**. The adverbs usually come before the main verb.

A: Have you **ever** lived in another country?
B: No, I've **never** lived in another country

> **Language note**: A common learner error is to use the adverb **ever** in affirmative statements. Notice the correct response in the example.
> 
> A: Have you **ever** been to Paris?
B: Yes, I have been to Paris.
