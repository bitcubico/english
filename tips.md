## Proper nouns

We use proper nouns to name things – people, businesses or places, for example. Proper nouns always begin with a capital letter,  which makes them easy to spot. Do not let these nouns confuse you. Look in their names for words you understand. For example,  in **Central Park**, you see the word **park**, which you know. In the following proper nouns, the key words for kinds of places are in bold. 

Use these words to help you understand the phrase.

e.g.
- The Monterey Bay **Aquarium**
- The Empire State **Building**
- Harry's **Bar and** Grill

Look at the paragraph to see how powerful a strategy using key words is. You don't have to read every word to understand a paragraph. 

You just need to understand the key words. In the following paragraph, the key words are in bold.

**Concert** in the **Park**

On **Saturday, June 23rd**, the Springfield **Orchestra** is going to **perform** Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. 

The concert **starts** at **3 p.m.** in Springfield **Park**. 
**Admission** is **$5** for adults and **$1** for children. **Tickets** are **available** online at www.springfield.orchestra.com.

## Suggesting activities

There are several ways to make suggestions for activities.

### 'Let's' + base form of verb

Let's go to the dance performance.

### 'How about' or 'what about' + verb + '-ing'

What about meeting some friends?

### 'Could' + base form of verb

We could go out for a drink at Harry's Bar

### 'Why don't we' + base form of verb

## Asking for information about movies

When you want to go to a movie, you need some basic information about it. You need to know when it starts,  where it is and how much it costs. You also need to know where to buy tickets. 

Use the following questions to get this information.

- Can you give me some information?
- Do you have a website?
- Can I buy tickets online?
- What's your address?
- What time is the next show?
- Are tickets still available?
- How much are tickets?

## Tag Question

Tag Questions are commonly used as conversational tools to ask for confirmation.

Use tag questions to confirm information you already think is true or to encourage someone to make small talk with you.

e.g.
- It’s a beautiful day, isn’t it?

### Rules to make these kind question

- When the statement is affirmative, the tag is negative
- When the statement is negative, the tag is affirmative
- Use the same verb tense or modal in the tag question as in the main statemen

e.g.
Afirmative Elements 

- You’re Lee, aren't you?
- She speaks Thai, doesn't she?
- There are a lot of rules, aren't there?
- You were there, weren't you?
- They left, didn't they?
- She is from a small town in China, isn't she?
- We’re late again, aren't we?
- She was at the last meeting, didn't she?
- You went to school with Charlie, didn't you?
- He smokes, doesn't he?
- She ate the sandwich, didn't she?

e.g.
Negative Elements 

- You’re not Amy, are you?
- There isn’t any sugar, is there?
- I don’t know you, do I?
- We didn’t know, did we?
- They aren’t on their way already, are they?
- He didn't finish writing the report, did he?
- She didn´t eat the sandwich, did she?

## Physical descriptions of people
When we describe a person's body, we usually talk about height and weight. Note that it is generally considered rude to call someone fat or overweight. However, overweight is less offensive when describing someone.

When describing height and weight, use the verb be.
- She is tall and thin

When we describe a person's face, we usually talk about eye color and any other notable features. For facial descriptions, we usually use the verb have.
- She has blue eyes
- He has a nice smile
- He has big ears
- She has long, brown hair.

When we describe a person's hair, we usually talk about length, type and color. A person with no hair is bald. Here are some useful adjectives:

- long
- short
- straight
- bald
- medium length
- curly
- blond

We usually use the verb have to describe a person's hair. If a person is bald, however, we use the verb be.

- She has long, straight, brown hair
- My father is bald

Say What does (person) look like? to ask about a person's size, shape, age or overall appearance. Use the verb be to describe overall appearance.

- What does he look like?
- He is tall and middle-aged. He's very good-looking

Use questions like What color are his eyes? and How tall is she? to ask for a description of specific parts of a person's body. Use the verb have to refer to body parts.

- What color are his eyes? (They're brown)
- How tall is she? (She's very tall)
- What do the children look like? (They have curly, red hair. Jasmine has big, brown eyes, and Jason has blue eyes)

Good-looking has the same meaning as attractive. Good-looking and attractive can be used for both men and women.

Beautiful is generally used for women, and handsome is generally used for men.

## 'Too' and 'enough'

Use **too +** adjective to say when something is more than necessary, or more than desired.

- Her project is late because she's _**too disorganized**_
- She's _**too negative**_. She thinks too much about problems

Use an adjective **+ enough** to say when something is sufficient or satisfactory.

- Carson is _**hardworking and efficient enough**_ to be the new manager

Use **not +** adjective **+ enough** to say when something is deficient or unsatisfactory.

- Sally's  _**not efficient enough**_
- He's  _**not creative enough**_  to work in marketing

## Opinions with 'I think that'

Say **I think that** to indicate you are expressing an opinion. Use **so do I** to agree with an opinion expressed by phrases such as **I think that** and **I like**.

- _**I think that**_  he does a really good job (_**So do I**_)
- _**I like**_  them both  (_**So do I**_)

Use **neither do I** to agree with an opinion expressed by **I don't think that**, or any other opinion expressed in the negative.

- _**I don't think**_ she's lazy (_**Neither do I**_)

Notice **that** can be dropped without the meaning of the sentence being affected.

To ask for someone's opinion, you can use **what do you think about** and **do you think**.

- _**What do you think about**_ Denise? (_**She's very efficient**_)
- _**Do you think**_ Paul is too disorganized? (_**No, not really**_)

## 'So' and 'such'

Use **so +** adjective or **so +** adverb to emphasize a personal quality.

e.g.
- Kyle is _**so disorganized**_
- She works _**so quickly**_

Use **such +** noun to emphasize a personal quality.

e.g.
- Debra is _**such a team player**_
- She shows _**such creativity**_
- Oscar is _**such a hard worker**_
