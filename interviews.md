I like hiking, biking, reading books, watching TV, spending time with my mom and friends, staying home, dancing, traveling. I'm a software engineer with more than twelve years of work experience in a lot of technologies, especially .Net, Javascript and Angular. In the way I've experimented with other syntaxis like: NodeJS, PHP, Python, React, Selenium and some others. Also a lot of databases like sql server, mysql, postgresql, mongo, and others.

***Interviewer***: My pleasure. Your resume is impressive. I think you are strong candidate for this position. I just have one question about your resume. **Who was your supervisor at Data System?**\
***Candidate***: Oh, that was Trisha Chambers. She left the company last month.

***Interviewer***: Why is that, and **why do you want to leave?**\
***Candidate***: Well, I'm looking for **more challenging work** and I don't think the work is challenging.

***Interviewer***: I see that you're currently working at DBX Systems. Why are you thinking of leaving?\

### Leadership Questions

***Interviewer***: **Why do you want to work for this company?**\
***Candidate***: I like this company because it's at the forefront of technology, it has quite interesting and challenging clients and projects, and its work environment seems spectacular to me.

***Interviewer***: Describe a coding situation where something didn't go as planned. **How did you fix it?**\
***Candidate***: At ARUS Company, I was a Teach Leader of a team of 7 members, we were assigned a project of great importance for one of our clients and with delivery dates not estimated by us and very tight in our opinion. So, As a technical lead, I first met with the client and asked him to tell me what were the most important functionalities he needed to offer to his clients, and I suggested going out with these initially to see the response of his clients and determine if it was worth implementing the features less important functionalities, fortunately, the client thought it was a good idea. By removing the various less important features, the delivery dates became feasible for the team and we were able to deliver on time.

***Interviewer***: **What technologies would  you use if** you had to complete a project from scratch in only a month?\
***Candidate***: I would use Python because of its short learning curve and most importantly because it is easier to find software developers who know its syntax.

***Interviewer***: **What do you do when it looks like a project** you are working on might miss a deadline?\
***Candidate***: I think it is important to keep the client up to date on their project and constantly communicate the status and when we reach that point where we are not going to achieve the delivery goal, negotiate with the client to modify the scope prioritizing the most important functionalities for their business in that delivery.

***Interviewer***: **What skills can you bring to this company?**\
***Candidate***: For me, the best thing I can give my employers is my passion for software development. I think that syntax is irrelevant when you are passionate about this art. On the other hand, I have more than 10 years of work experience developing with .Net technologies, around 3 years using Angular, and I also have other knowledge of other languages. I work very well in a team and I adapt quickly.

### Technical Questions

***Interviewer***: **How much experience do you have with .Net?**\
***Candidate***: I started developing with Visual Studio 6 and since then I have not stopped developing with this technology, I have more than 12 years of experience using this technology.

***Interviewer***: **Do you know the SOLID principles?**\
***Candidate***: Yes, I know them, these are a guide that helps us develop quality software. I remember that the S means Single Responsibility, the O means open and close to changes, the L means Liskov substitution, the I means interface segregation and D means dependency inversion.

***Interviewer***: **What it's the meaning of S (Single Responsibility)?**\
***Candidate***: Well, it's means that a class must have a single responsibility, for example if we have a class called washing machine it shouldn't have clothes dryer functionalities, although they are similar and have functionalities in common, each one has different responsibilities and it's best to keep them intact.

***Interviewer***: **What it's the meaning of O (Open and close to changes)?**\
***Candidate***: Well, it means that the classes should be open to be extended and closed to be modified.

***Interviewer***: **What it's the meaning of L ( Liskov substitution)?**\
***Candidate***: I don't remember its definition, but I think it means that if we use a class we could use any of its subclasses without changing anything in my software.

***Interviewer***: **What it's the meaning of I (Interface segregation)?**\
***Candidate***: Well, it means that we should make interfaces for specific functionality. It is better to have many interfaces than one with many functionalities, its maintenance is easier.

***Interviewer***: **What it's the meaning of D (Dependency inversion)?**\
***Candidate***: This principle tells us about the importance of reducing dependencies between modules, which is why it suggests that we inherit from abstract classes and not from concrete classes.

***Interviewer***: **What it's the meaning of Polymorphism?**\
***Candidate***: Well, it refers to the possibility of defining classes with different names and attributes or methods called the same and obtaining different behaviors.

***Interviewer***: **What is the difference between public, protected and internal access modifiers?**\
***Candidate***: Well, the public modifier is used to specify that access is not restricted, so the property or method with this modifier can be used from any instance of the class, protected is used to specify that access is limited to types derived from the containing class, so this modifier restricts the use of the property or method to classes that inherit from it. And internal is used to specify that access is limited to the current assembly, the type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly but not from another assembly.
