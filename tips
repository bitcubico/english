## Proper nouns

We use proper nouns to name things â€“ people, businesses or places, for example. Proper nouns always begin with a capital letter, 
which makes them easy to spot. Do not let these nouns confuse you. Look in their names for words you understand. For example, 
in **Central Park**, you see the word **park**, which you know. In the following proper nouns, the key words for kinds of places are in bold. 
Use these words to help you understand the phrase.

e.g.
- The Monterey Bay **Aquarium**
- The Empire State **Building**
- Harry's **Bar and** Grill

Look at the paragraph to see how powerful a strategy using key words is. You don't have to read every word to understand a paragraph. 
You just need to understand the key words. In the following paragraph, the key words are in bold.\
